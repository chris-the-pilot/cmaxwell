Learning, evolution, and adaptation. A few of the reasons why humans have such an amazing power to create. However, sometimes we get stuck or plateau, we don’t know what to do or can’t do it because of a lack of skill. Then some people seem so far ahead of us and seem to know exactly what to do in a situation. And they seem to be able to do so in an amazing and effortless flow.

To achieve flow we need to understand a part of humans that allowed us to evolve into where we are today. That part is pattern recognition, we’ll look at how it goes together with learning and how it can be applied to achieve flow.

Humans are animals of pattern recognition. We are so ingrained to look for patterns that we’ll see them in random datasets. Have you ever looked at clouds and seen the shape of a dragon, a flower, an elephant, or anything else? Most of us probably have, and the clouds probably didn’t intentionally try to look like a dragon, flower, or elephant. They were just clouds being cloud-shaped. Yet we were able to see a pattern. This is how strong pattern recognition is in us, humans.

From a very early age (at least 3 months old) we start noticing patterns. We start recognizing our mother's voice and how to hold on to items. This recognition is the act of learning. From that, we can infer that pattern recognition is what we do when we learn. Therefore learning is about seeing patterns. Once we learn a pattern we’re able to apply it in different situations.

To learn patterns you want to do so in reduced complexity. The reason is that situations that only highlight a single pattern enable you to find it incredibly quickly. Once you’ve acquired and internalized the recognition of a pattern you’ll be able to apply it in advanced situations. With practice, you’ll be able to chain multiple patterns together into an incredible and inspiring flow.

Through repetition and practice, you’ll find patterns that build the fundamentals and principles of your field. This is a part of how you achieve mastery in any field and perform with flow. Now go practice in reduced complexity to learn the patterns of your craft and become a master.

Love you
