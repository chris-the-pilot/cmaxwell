+++
Just because you come up with an idea or read about something (even if it’s from an “expert”), you don’t know if it’s accurate or true. What you have is an assumption that something works a certain way. To validate the idea, you need to test it to see for yourself if it’s the case. Once you’ve seen for yourself and can predictably achieve the result the idea portrays, then you have validated your learning and it can be repeated for consistent and predictable results.
