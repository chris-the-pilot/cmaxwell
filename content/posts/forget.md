Humans are amazing creatures. We are capable of creating the most inspiring and jaw-dropping feats imaginable. However, a lot of the time we get stuck and don’t use our full potential.

One way to get unstuck is to free up mental space and focus on what we humans are designed to do, create. What we often do is waste mental space on remembering things. Instead of using our mental capabilities for remembering things we should free it up to process things. If our mental capacity is free to process things we can create, we can produce amazing work.

When you ask someone what they had for breakfast yesterday they might remember. If you ask someone what they had for breakfast exactly one year ago, chances are that most people won’t remember. Of course, this doesn’t just apply to remembering what you had for breakfast, it applies to anything, whether it’s something you did, heard, or saw. Unless you use a memory technique and deliberately choose to remember something specific, your long-term memory is fallible.

Not only is our long-term memory fallible, but our short-term memory is also fallible. When someone reads a book, how much can they remember from one sitting? We might remember the main idea, but most people wouldn’t be able to retell what they read, let alone retell it word-by-word. For those reasons both our short-term and long-term memories are fallible.

We shouldn’t rely on our memories because they use up our mental capacity to process information and data. If we try to come up with ideas through brainstorming, we might come up with 10 or 100s different ideas. Trying to keep it all in the head is counter-productive. Instead of remembering everything, we can use external memory devices that free up mental capacity so we can focus on being producers and creators.

Your memory is important but not for things that can be easily stored in an external memory device. As humans, we were designed to be creators and producers. We created external memory devices so we can focus on creating. Go use these external memory devices, free up space in your mind, and focus on producing amazing work and creations.
