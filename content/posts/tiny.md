Sometimes we commit to doing something and for whatever reason, we don’t really feel like doing it or we aren’t capable of going all out. It might be that we’re feeling under the weather or just pressed for time. Doing anything is just a behavior. When it comes to behavior we will only do the behavior that is consistent with our self-image and identity. For us to keep doing a behavior we need to want to do it and we need to feel successful doing it. Besides that we need to get prompted to act and the easier it is to act the lower our motivation to do it is necessary. The easiest way to make it easy to perform a behavior is to keep it tiny. That means doing the smallest version possible. In the case that you don’t feel like doing something for whatever reason, you’ll still be able to do it and keep it consistent and stack the rocks to your desired identity. Make sure to celebrate the tiny action as it will compound and get massive results.

See you next time!
