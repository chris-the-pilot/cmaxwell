As the leaves begin to turn orange and red, and the leaves fall off the trees it’s mother earth giving us a cue to slow down and release what we no longer need to hold on to. For that reason, I’m slowing down for the winter as well. I hope you’ve been able to grow from my posts. I’ll see you in spring when it’s time to blossom and explore again. For now, I wish you a peaceful and relaxing autumn and winter with lots of love. One last word before I leave you for now. Remember the formula for behavior change, B=M*A*P. All behavior occurs when motivation and ability align over the action line for when you’re prompted. Motivation is only one piece of the puzzle and should also be the last one you look at when planning for behavior change.
