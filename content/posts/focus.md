The quality of your life is determined by your habitual states. In previous posts, I’ve covered both state management and how to control your state using your physiology. In those posts, I’ve defined that the way you feel at any moment of time is determined by the state you’re currently in. The two factors that control your state are physiology and focus. The best thing is that these two factors are completely controlled by you. The reason it’s essential that we control our own states is that the way we perform in any given moment is determined by the state we’re currently in. E.g. Do you behave the same when you’re feeling frustrated vs feeling like you’re on a roll? Focus is the second way to control our state.

Today I’ll dive deeper into focus and show how focus can help you feel energized and great. To understand the effects of focus we will look at what it is, why we do it, how we misuse it, and how we can direct and control it.

The only experience we have in life is how we feel physically and what we pay attention to. Focus is what we pay attention to. The reason we focus and pay attention to things is our brains are trying to help us determine how what is going on will help us survive and thrive. How the things going on will help us avoid pain and gain pleasure. Somewhere along the way, people get caught up in habitual patterns of focus. If those patterns of focus are on things that bring you down, then you will feel down.

In order to feel empowered, you need to focus on what will empower you. The two things we control with our mind are what we focus on and how we’re focusing on it. Imagine your brain like a camera, it can only take in so much of something, and you only feel what you focus on. You, therefore, need to take control of your one camera to change what you focus on. How do you take control of your own camera? The way you control the camera of your mind is based on how you evaluate things. How do you evaluate things? The way you evaluate things is based on the questions you ask yourself. IN order to feel empowered you need to ask yourself empowering questions. Let me give you a few examples:

* What could I be excited about in my life right now?
* What about that makes me excited?
* How does that make me feel?
* What could I be happy about in my life right now?

There you go! You now have everything you need to control your own state. In order to improve the quality of your life you need to improve the quality of your habitual states, the way you do that is by controlling and directing your physiology and focus. Your life is ultimately your own responsibility.
