Consistency is key. By taking consistent action you let compounding work towards shaping a new version of yourself. It’s your choice to choose what you want to shape yourself into. But by being consistent, even if that means just showing up you let momentum run in your favor and compound on itself. If you keep your behavior tiny it’s easy to stay consistent and you can easily get up if you fall down and let it compound and continue to metamorphose into your desired self.

Stay consistent and see you next time.
