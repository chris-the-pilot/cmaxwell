Products exist to help us, whether that feeds our bellies or warms us, or at a higher level, helps us with our transcendence. The point of a product is not just to buy and be of no value. We buy products because they assist and aid us in our transformation. They help us get our jobs done better. When we get our jobs done better we can evolve and getter better results as long as the products work. Good products should make our lives better.
