Have you ever experienced someone being stubborn and not listening to what you have to say? Most likely they’re jammed to one side of thinking and don’t want to accept the truth. In other words, they’re close-minded. To be able to find the truth we need to be open-minded.

If we become open-minded we won’t be as affected by other people being close-minded. We get disconnected from each other when both sides of people are close-minded. For us to become open-minded we need to understand that life’s dualities are not static nor are they black and white. When we understand how life’s dualities follow a continuum that is ever-evolving and changing we need to be okay with the fact that the side we’re on is going to change based on the facts changing. Finally, we can win by being open-minded and not picking a side.

Healthy and unhealthy, in society, we believe you need to eat healthy in order to be healthy. But without unhealthy foods, we can’t have healthy food. And too much of the healthy stuff can become unhealthy. Without unhealthy we have no healthy. It’s the duality of black and white, there is no light without darkness.

This duality follows a continuum that is connected with one another. On one side you have healthy, on the other side, you have unhealthy. As new facts arise and situations change the ultimate truth is going to be a combination of the two somewhere in the middle of the continuum.

If you want to win and know the truth, open your mind. For a moment in time let both sides be correct because both sides probably have ounces of truth to them. Review the ideas critically and take the truth from each side. If you do it correctly you will land somewhere in the middle of the continuum.

The only way you can lose is by picking a side and jamming on either extreme. You can have no good without evil but good can become evil if you’re jammed on the side of goodness.

Until next time!
