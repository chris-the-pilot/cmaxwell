Knowledge is not power, knowledge is potential power. Knowledge is trumped every day by action. You can learn as much as possible about a topic or skill but without putting it into action someone with inferior knowledge who does take action will beat you every day of the week. Not only will they beat you, but they will also surpass your level of knowledge in that area quickly because they’ll be acquiring practical experience. It’s like trying to learn to ride a bike by only watching videos or reading books. You might know theoretically better how to ride a bike but the person who actually gets on a bike will be the one who knows how to. The way you reach peak-performance in a field is by cycling between learning and practicing, you need to both.

See you next time!
