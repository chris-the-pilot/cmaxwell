Repetition is the mother of skill. If you want to get skilled at something you need to stay consistent with practice and know what level you want to achieve. With your goal in mind, you can focus on deliberately achieving it quicker than you can imagine. To get even better quicker begin with practicing in reduced complexities to internalize the fundamentals. With the fundamentals internalized you’ll be able to connect them and see patterns others can’t and you can combine them into a natural flow freeing your conscious mind to capture smaller details available to only the skilled.

Happy weekend and see you next time!
