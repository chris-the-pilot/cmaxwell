Ever felt stuck, in doubt of yourself, or just not knowing what to do? It can be a grueling feeling which perpetuates into a void of negativity. When we feel stuck and doubt ourselves we just want to get out of the situation and get to our desired results. But getting to that destination can feel completely hopeless when in a negative and disempowered state.

There can be multiple reasons for feeling a disempowered and negative state. But it really boils down to two things. Your physiology and your psychology. You can be highly affected by a physiological change in your body. And you can be highly affected by a psychological focus in your mind. Both are vital for you to go from doubtful to hopeful and resourceful.

The first step is to make sure you aren’t being affected by a physiological change in your body. This might come from eating the wrong foods which cause you to get headaches, painful stomachs, eczema, blood sugar spikes, or anything else. You might also have improper or lack of sleep which is making you feel off and slow. Your state is highly affected by physiological changes in your body from anything you do.

The worst part is that if you’re affected by a physiological change that is making you worse you probably focus on how much worse you’re feeling. This self-perpetuates into even more negativity and amplifies the negative feeling making you feel even worse and less capable. You might ask yourself questions like “Why do I feel so horrible?” or “Why can’t I feel good?”. It creates a vicious feedback loop.

What we focus on is determined by the questions we ask ourselves. If we ask “Why do I feel so horrible?” you will focus on how horrible you feel and come up with an answer, even if it’s not based on reality. The reason being is that our brain is like a supercomputer that will answer any questions you give it. And oftentimes we limit ourselves by asking bad questions which lead to bad answers, it’s like we put self-imposed brakes on which are created from our self-image, identity, beliefs, and world-views.

The same applies when we feel stuck, doubt ourselves, or don’t know what to do. We are simply focusing on the wrong things. We might be focusing on how things can’t be done instead of how things could be done. Consciously or unconsciously you’re always asking yourself questions. When you feel stuck or doubtful, take a step back and pause. Look at the situation from a distance and figure out what you want to accomplish. Then become resourceful by asking a better question. For example, “What is the question I need answered right now?”, or “What would I do if I had no limitations?”.

By asking better questions you change your focus and release your brakes and let your creativity flow. You now have the tool for you to get unstuck and create hope instead of doubt. Believe in your ability to figure it out and find the answer. It might take a little time but you will find the way if you’re open to receiving it.

Best wishes and until next time!
