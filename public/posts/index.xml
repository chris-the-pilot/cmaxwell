      <description>This website, my personal website was setup to have a clean and sleek look with the capabilities of posting a blog. Having a specific CMS platform like WordPress was too much work and maintenance for a simple platform that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to maintain. On top of that I did not want to run a server because of needing to setup scalable and fault-tolerant infrastructure. Another concern was the security risk putting up a server on LAMP stack would entail meaning I&amp;rsquo;d have to manage that extra risk.</description>
